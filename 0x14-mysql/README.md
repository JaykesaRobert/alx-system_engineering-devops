## About
Replication is the process of creating and maintaining copies of a database, typically across multiple servers, for the purpose of load balancing, redundancy, and disaster recovery. MySQL replication involves the use of a master-slave architecture, where one server acts as the master and the other servers act as slaves. The master server receives and processes all write requests and then replicates these changes to the slave servers in real-time. This allows for read scaling and high availability, as well as the ability to distribute load across multiple servers
