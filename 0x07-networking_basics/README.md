> Networking basics

## Intro
Networking is the backbone of our digital world. It connects us to information, people, and resources, making our daily lives easier and more productive. Whether you're just starting out in your career or you're a seasoned professional looking to expand your knowledge, understanding the basics of networking is a crucial skill that can help you achieve your goals. In this project, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of networking, from the components that make up a network to the protocols that govern communication between devices. We'll also look at how networks are used in real-world applications, and provide tips and best practices for setting up and maintaining a secure and efficient network. So, if you're ready to dive into the world of networking, let's get started
