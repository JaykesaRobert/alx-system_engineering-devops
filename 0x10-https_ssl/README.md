## About
In today's digital age, security is of utmost importance, and one of the primary methods of ensuring secure communication over the internet is by using HTTPS and SSL/TLS.

HTTPS, short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure and is a protocol used to encrypt data that is transmitted over the internet. SSL/TLS, on the other hand, stands for Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security and is a protocol that provides secure communication over the internet by encrypting data between two communicating parties. Let's have a explore them in this project.
